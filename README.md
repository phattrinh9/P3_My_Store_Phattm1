# MyStore Application

## Project Overview

MyStore is the second project in the Udacity Full Stack JavaScript course. It's a fully functional single-page e-commerce application built using Angular, aptly named MyStore. The application features a product page where users can view a list of products, along with forms on the main product list page, product detail page, and the cart page itself.

## Built With

- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.3
- Node.js
- HTML, CSS
- TypeScript

## Development Setup

1. Install all necessary dependencies by running `npm install`.
2. Start the development server by running `ng serve`.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Code Generation

You can generate new components using Angular CLI. Run `ng generate component component-name`. Additionally, you can generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Execute unit tests using Karma by running `ng test`.

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests using a platform of your choice. Prior to using this command, ensure you have added a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
